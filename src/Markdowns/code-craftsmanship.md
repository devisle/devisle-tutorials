# Code Craftsmanship

How you view your skills experience, how others will see you and how you approach any task drastically changes when you treat development with the upmost respect as a craftsmanship.

## Three golden rules to craftsmanship

I have condensed all the traits mentioned by individuals, gained experiences and best practices into three golden rules to keep sharp and continuously improving.

### Rule 1: Let your work speak for itself

Craftsman developers know how to communicate politely, strictly and using the relevant terminology. We should avoid bragging on how good we are with anything, let your work speak for itself. Let others come to you to understand your thoughts, communicate more, do demonstrations, sit down with others and talk.
Share what you like, do a presentation on a new shiny feature on a tool, present thoughts or challenges to a wider audience, engage them.

### Rule 2: Practice deliberately

Do not go a day without practicing in an area you feel weak in, whether its going over that code you need to refactor, an improved algorithm or a new quicker tool.
Practice, practice and practice some more, but not what you already know, only you can feel what you are bad at or how can you improve an existing situation.
Practice with a defined intention, be motivated even if it takes days or weeks, enjoy struggling and focus on the outcome. Decide what is a pain and what the perfect outcome will be. Work like a dog at 4 am, skip lunch to cover more or spend time on the weekend doing it, get yourself alleviated.

### Rule 3: Fail a lot

Fail at innovating.
Fail as much as you can in every conceivable development scenario
Spend time trying approaches you don't use very often
