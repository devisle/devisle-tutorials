## Software Developer/Engineer: Starting out and Evolving

-   When you're starting out as Developer, or an Engineer, Everyone gives out advise on how to approach the learning by giving us strong suggestions on Languages, Code Editors, IDEs, help you to learn, eventually give you the skillset to land you a job and start earning by doing what you love (I assume you didn't get in this industry just for the shiny pay and bragging rights :P).

-   But what comes on later or rather isn't relayed outright to you, is that Languages, are just part of the learning process. The first step is to understand that there are many things a Developer should grasp, conceptualize and understand, before trying to learn tools which aide implementing/translating it into code.

-   Whether you went to College for a degree in CS, or were self-taught in your journey, you tend to be exposed to a different learning path. I do sincerely believe learning programming algorithms and math are just as important as learning programming languages, but are severly incomplete without understanding/learning the Patterns, styles and the approaches which are critical.

## When you're developing an Application, you're faced with typically challenges.

1. Satisfy users's expectations
2. Keep satisfying user's expectations, consistently when you add new features and scale up your application.

## The Foundation

-   **Programming Paradigms:** What are they? And how do we begin?

-   **The Clean Code**: Learning what constitutes Clean Code, and how to write Clean Code.

-   **Programming Fundamentals**

-   **Programming Language:** Choose a Programming Language of your interest or one which is very important in the particular doman you are trying to get into. However, as you progress, you should learn the craft, and not just the tools. Meaning the rest of this lineup is just as important if not even more so, than the programming language you choose to specialize yourself in. Learning the craft means you have stepped up your knowledge and understanding, where you can switch between tools and understand the problem on a fundamental level, and come up with solutions and how to effectively implement them using the Principles, Styles Patterns.

-   **Design Principles:** Concepts allow you to write flexible, maintainable code which also is very much testable.

-   **Design Patterns:** Patterns which are Solutions commonly used to solve problems, and how to apply them at the base level.

-   **Architecture Principles:** Learning, establishing relationships between components and how to manage them, identify architectural boundaries(limits) and high-level policy.

-   **Architecture Styles:** Different approaches to organizing our code into high-level modules and defining relationships between them

-   **Architecture Patterns:** Patterns which allow you to implement Architectural Styles in order to solve a problemm

-   **Enterprise Patterns:** This goes ones step further. This is where you would be going all-in, basically getting to know the your chosen Architectural Patterns inside-out, and fully understanding it's implementation and how to achieve optimum with SQAs (System Quality Attributes)

SQAs are metrics which we measure in order to satisfy our users. These include Speed, Reliability, Availability, Scalability. And some of these are given a higher importance depending on the Domain, nature of application and how you approach to scaling/adding new features in the long run.

## Here is a nice way to understand the above Foundation list.

Think constructing a House.

-   Programming Fundamentals constituting the basics when it comes to what is what when building a house (Brick, Cement, Water, Pipes, Utilities).

-   Programming Languages are the Tools/Equipment you use to build the house.

-   Programming Paradigms are the field/base foundation of the house.

-   Clean Code is how you build a house, and how to build it good. And what constitutes a good house (Features/Decisions you took to make it right)

-   Design Principles are where you understood how you can optimize your construction with a good layout for your house, one which is open for expansion or upgrades in the future and maintaining is a breeze. These also include using the appropriate materials or construction depending on the Area where you're building the house (Geolocation difficulties include, bad soil, Natural calamities prone etc.)

-   Design Patterns are the solutions which are tried/tested, and you use to apply them to your house. (How to build your house in certain conditions (read problem)).

-   Architecture Styles are how you organize the house's system behind the scenes. Electricals, Piping, Sewage outflow and air movement.

-   Architecture Patterns are patterns or commonly used solutions to implement the architecture styles.

-   Enterprise Patterns cane be where you've decided what kind of Architecture pattern you're going to end up using, but like it says, you will be following through what it takes to implement the Architecture pattern, knowing it inside-out and making your project optimal.

### As you can see, Programming Languages are merely part of the learning process, yet in the beginning there is a huge importance and attention given to it.

### TLDR: Learn the Craft, not just the tools to use. It's not about the end-goal, but the journey you take to reach there. Learn not for the sake of it, but understand what constitutes to your own development and growth.
