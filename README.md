# Straight to the point tutorials

If you would like to contribute a tutorial read the below steps from step 1, else if would like to contribute to the website, please skip step 2 only:

## 1. Access to Github Organization

First you must join the Github organization, if you haven't already done so, it helps if we already know who you are on the discord.

### 2. Write your tutorial

All our tutorials are rendered via markdown format, all contributions belong inside the Markdowns folder.

### 3. Ask to contribute to the Github repository

Once you are happy with a tutorial, ask one of the discord admins or github repository admins to give you collaborator access so that you may submit a pull request later on.

### 4. Clone the repo

Git clone the tutorial repository to your development machine, make a new development branch, if you are contribute a tutorial then place your markdown file inside the Markdowns folder and update the Catalog.js file inside the folder too. Catalog.js will be how the tutorial appears in the search list on the main page. Otherwise, your coded contributions will also be looked at on submission.

### 5. Test and Submit

If you can test that the site is working as normal with the newly added content it would be great! additionally, we will check when you submit the Pull Request, so please help us by being specific with what you changed.

Feel free to ask for help on the discord if you get stuck at any of these steps.
